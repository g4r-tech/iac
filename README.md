### 🌠 Best Practices
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Avoid manual changes; rebuild and redeploy instead.
- **Version Control**: Treat infrastructure code as software: use version control, code reviews, and continuous integration.
- **Modularity**: Use modules to create reusable, composable, and maintainable infrastructure code.
